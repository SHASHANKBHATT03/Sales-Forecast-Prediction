# Sales-Forecast-Prediction

📄 Project Name: Sales Forecast Prediction

🔍 Description:
This project is designed to forecast future sales using Python. In this, we analyze past sales data and try to accurately predict sales in the coming time with the help of machine learning algorithms.

🧠 Technologies and Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Dataset: Sales records in CSV format

⚙️ Key Steps:

1. Data Loading and Cleaning

2. Data Analysis and Visualization

3. Feature Engineering

4. Model Training – Such as Linear Regression

5. Model Evaluation using RMSE

6. Prediction

📈 Output:
The model gives the sales forecast for the upcoming period based on the past sales trends.

✅ Usage:
This project can be useful in sectors like retail, FMCG, e-commerce etc. where decisions are taken based on sales data.

📁 Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
(These can be installed by `pip install` command)

💡 Note:
This is an educational project and may require testing and improvements on additional data before actual business decisions can be made.
